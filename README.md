# Hi, I'm Ansh :computer:

![Image](https://anshjainpublic.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Banner.png)

I'm currently a Computer Science and Math double major at **The University of Texas at Austin**, with a minor in Economics. I'm looking for software engineering internships in either Spring or Summer 2021. I love playing music, playing video games, and organizing hackathons (contact me if you're interested in in sponsoring [HackTX](http://freetailhackers.com))! I also enjoy full-stack and cloud development, particularly with technologies like Flask, Spring Boot, ReactJS, and assorted AWS services.
